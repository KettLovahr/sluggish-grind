You're a deeply indebted slug who needs to get 100 coins quick, but no job can get you the money you need as fast as you need it.

It's time to visit the dungeon, where you will find plenty coin-and-slug-devouring jellycats, a lonely dragon shopkeeper and many coins among deadly traps.

Go from slow, frail and helpless to absolutely berserk and extremely mobile as you collect coins and purchase tools essential for a successful expedition to the depths.

Once you have all the coins you need, make a safe return to the top and bask in the glory of an extremely rewarding and enjoyable end screen.
